# Spiders
### _Everything is Spiders_

Spiders is an esoteric language created for no particular reason. This project consists of two parts: an inefficient CPU simulator which is roughly kind of inspired by x86, and the Spiders language which runs on the aforementioned simulator.

## The language

The Spiders language is an incarnation of the worldview that everything is spiders (spiders spiders spiders). The syntax uses the same concept as the [Chicken language](http://torso.me/chicken).

## The processor

The CPU simulator (currently unnamed) on which this implementation of Spiders runs is based on the [x86 architecture](http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/), and somewhat inspired by [FakeASM](http://esolangs.org/wiki/FakeASM).

The CPU simulator is _definitely not_ trying to be efficient, nor necessarily accurate to actual processors. It is being built simply for the enjoyment of the author. If you want something to run better, submit a PR and we'll talk :).
