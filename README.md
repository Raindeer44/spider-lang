Spider is an esoteric programming language, pulling inspiration from many sources, with the notable influence of [a legendary post on r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2t73j8/what_if_everything_was_spiders/). This repository contains an informal definition of the language, as well a na√Øve interpreter.
